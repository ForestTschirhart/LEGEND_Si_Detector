This series of tests was to see if Sam's room really had less electrical noise than the LEGEND lab. 
The 150 um detector was pulsed with a function generator.

The analog test was using the analog HV supply, while the chamber was connected to the turbo pump with no isolation.
The analog break test was also using the analog HV supply but with the vacuum chamber separated from the pump and ion guage with ceramic breaks.
The digital test was using the digital HV supply that is used for SiPM tests, also while the chamber was isolated from the pump and guage with ceramic breaks.


The notebooks in this folder analyze the data from these pulse tests and optimize the rise and flat parameters for data processing such that 
the FWHM of the energy spectrum is minimized. This is also done for old pulser data from the LEGEND Lab room. The e res looks similar but
this could be due to digitizer change (now using 500 MHz digitizer, used to use 250 MHz).
