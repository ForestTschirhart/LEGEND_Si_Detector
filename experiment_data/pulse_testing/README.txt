AIR RUN 1, 3, and LINAMP
    These were, respectively, pulser tests of the 150 and 500 um detectors in air, and a pulser test of the 500um detector in air using the linear amplifier

PULSER TEST 2, 2_HIEGHTMATCHED, and 2_ALPHAS
    These were, respectively, a pulser test of the 150um detector, a pulser test of the 150 um detector such that the pulse amplitude matched
    that of real alpha signals, and a quick collection of alpha data with the 150um detector so that we would have the adc value for mean alpha energy to normalize the pulser
    data peaks to. With the peaks normalized we could compare resolution (FWHM) of pulser test guassian with that of previous alpha data.
