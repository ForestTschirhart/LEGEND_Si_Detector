This repository holds all of the code developed for the silicon detector project under the UW LEGEND lab. 

Pls excuse my horrible file system organization, it somehow made sense to me when I was writing the code, and when I uploaded to github I didn't want to move anything around and break the dependencies. 

To keep the github repo size reasonable I didn't upload any of the large data files that the scripts and notebooks use. These files are in the .lh5 format, and came from the LEGEND dspeed build_dsp code. If someone is picking up the project at a later date and wants to look at some of my data I am happy to send it to you!
Just email foresttschirhart@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading :)
